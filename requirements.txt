# Note: The pre-trained models in the model/ directory were trained with older versions
# of TensorFlow (1.14.0) and Keras (2.2.4). To use these models with the updated libraries:
# 1. You may need to retrain the models with the new versions, OR
# 2. Load models using tf.compat.v1 compatibility mode
# 
# For security reasons, we've updated all dependencies to patched versions.
# If you experience model loading issues, please retrain the models using StockMovement.ipynb
